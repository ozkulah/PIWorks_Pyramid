Upload Lines into objects
  - Each object has a value, depthOfLine and isPrimeNumber(bool)
  - While adding objects to list , Check the value is it a prime or not.
After List is filled
  - Make a recursive method call on list and calculate maximum sum of a path according to limitations
  - It uses DFS algorith to find a path and max sum
